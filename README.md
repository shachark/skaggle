# skaggle
SK's Kaggle utilities

These are general utilities that I've found useful when competing in Kaggle competitions.

Note: This is not really a standalone package, it is merely a part of my data science pipeline. It is a unified framework (there are many others out there) for training models from simple GLMs to cutting edge GBMs and NNs.

#### To install diectly from GitHub:
```
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('shachark/ComputeBackend')
```
